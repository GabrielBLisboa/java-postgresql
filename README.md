After working with Spring Boot (with JPA and H2 dependencies) I had this chance to manage a database with plain Java (no frameworks) wich was very usefull to understand what that was so special that the framework was doing.

Every connection, instantiation and query was made by coding.

The local server ran with a <b> PostgresSQL </b> database and the cheking was made with <b> pgAdmin4 </b>.

This project was created by <b> @devsuperior</b> as a OO and SQL review exercise.
